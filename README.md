After an absence i have ve been able to get back to the projects i was planning to do. With the next game in perspective, i first wanted to make a clean menu by trying something new, playing with colors, opacity, color interpolation (i discovered this and wanted to test it out) and adding several menus (start, games, pause, settings...). I also tried to manage the change of resolution for the game window and the management of the keys the user wants to use, all saved so that the settings can be reused later.

Here's a GIF showing it :
